Vaishnav P. Varma is a postgraduate in Bioinformatics from Alagappa University, specializing in structural bioinformatics, immunoinformatics, and reverse vaccinology. Under the mentorship of Dr. M. Karthikeyan, his M.Sc. research focused on designing a multi-epitope vaccine candidate against Hepatitis B Virus using computational pipelines integrating epitope prediction, antigenicity screening, and immune response profiling.

He holds an Indian patent for a novel tree sap collection apparatus aimed at reducing the risk of Nipah virus transmission—an innovation inspired by his early interest in zoonotic viruses and epidemic preparedness. His broader interests include host–pathogen interactions, viral structure modeling, and AI-driven solutions for infectious disease research.
